Machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies are becoming increasingly capable and impactful in today's data-driven world. In the near future, society expects to see highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. OpenAI's mission is to ensure that such artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems benefit all of humanity. Through world-class open research in various areas ranging reinforcement learning and natural language processing, we strive to build socially beneficially thought leadership in the AI industry. Our research is centered on the pursit of safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome. To that end, we commit to the following principles:

Broadly Distributed Benefits
Long-Term Safety
Technical Leadership
Cooperative Orientation
